    <h1>Welcome to Ozsel Kilinc&#8217;s Ph.D. Work&nbsp;Page</h1>
<h2>Clustering-based Source-aware Assessment of True Robustness for Learning&nbsp;Models</h2>
<p>We introduce a novel validation framework to measure the true robustness of learning 
models for real-world applications by creating source-inclusive and source-exclusive 
partitions in a dataset via clustering. We develop a robust- ness metric derived from 
source-aware lower and upper bounds of model accuracy even when data source labels are 
not readily available. We clearly demonstrate that even on a well-explored dataset like 
<span class="caps">MNIST</span>, challenging training scenarios can be constructed under the proposed assessment 
framework for two separate yet equally important applications: i) more rigorous learning 
model comparison and ii) dataset adequacy evaluation. In addition, our findings not only 
promise a more complete identification of trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy 
and robustness but can also help researchers optimize their efforts in data collection by 
identifying the less robust and more challenging class&nbsp;labels.</p>

<h2>Deep Clustering using Auto-Clustering Output&nbsp;Layer</h2>
<p>In this paper, we propose a novel method to enrich the representation provided to the 
output layer of feedforward neural networks in the form of an auto-clustering output 
layer (<span class="caps">ACOL</span>) which enables the network to naturally create sub-clusters under the provided 
main class la- bels. In addition, a novel regularization term is introduced which allows 
<span class="caps">ACOL</span> to encourage the neural network to reveal its own explicit clustering objective. 
While the underlying process of finding the subclasses is completely unsupervised, 
semi-supervised learning is also possible based on the provided classification objective. 
The results show that <span class="caps">ACOL</span> can achieve a 99.2% clustering accuracy for the semi-supervised 
case when partial class labels are presented and a 96% accuracy for the unsupervised 
clustering case. These findings represent a paradigm shift especially when it comes to 
harnessing the power of deep networks for primary and secondary clustering applications 
in large&nbsp;datasets.</p>
